# Weather-app
Weather app based on GUI to search any city's temperature using an API.
I have used WeatherBit API for fetching weather data. 
This app first finds the deviceâ€™s location coordinates. 
Then it send's this data to the API via an API key. 
The API send a JSON from which we extract the required data that is the temperature and city of the location.
